# Markdown Previewer App

This program is an online Markdown viewer, which allows the user to type text in a text editor and see the formatted output in real-time 
in another area. It is based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses the Marked library to interpret Markdown and render it as HTML. 
The program fulfills several user stories, such as allowing text input in the editor, displaying formatted output in real-time, interpreting 
Markdown elements, and making the program's visual appealing and modern. This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).
